# Softec-25

A full-stack web app rapidly developed for SOFTEC '25 — Pakistan's largest tech event — built purely in a few days under extreme time pressure.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Frontend: **Next + TypeScript**
- Backend: **Fast API** 
- WebSockets: **Nest JS**

## 📂 Project Structure
- `/frontend`
- `/backend`
- `/websocket`

## 🎯 About the Project
This project was our hackathon entry for SOFTEC '25. Initially, we were told to submit just an idea proposal, but days before the event, we were informed that a working MVP was required — pushing us into a race against time. In just 3-4 days, we built:
- A near-complete responsive frontend 
- A backend with some user management 
- A dedicated WebSocket server for real-time functionalities

The focus was on rapid feature delivery, quick integrations, and clean UI/UX.
